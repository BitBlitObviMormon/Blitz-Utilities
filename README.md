# Drive Security
Repeatedly polls your disk drives to check if any have been removed. If any have been removed then an alarm will play and a note will pop up stating which drive has been removed. I wrote this program to let me know when someone was stealing my flash drive from a public computer (which happened more often than you'd think).

# JCrypt
A simple 8-bit XOR file encryptor. I used this program to disguise executables as generic files to bypass the school's file-sharing firewall. It also has the bonus of making the files useless to anyone, but you.
